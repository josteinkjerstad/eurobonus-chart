# About

EuroBonus Charts provides a visual representation of your SAS EuroBonus points, making it easy to see where you have earned all your points over the years.

### What does it look like?

[Head over to our demo](./showcase) to take a look!

### How do I upload my transactions?

To upload your transactions, simply log in to your SAS profile and download your transaction history as an xlsx file and upload this file either in the "Try it out" page or in your profil settings.

### Will my transactions be stored?

Only if you log in. Your transactions are safe with us and only you can access them.

### Why should I log in?

Logging in allows you access your data without needing to upload the data again. Also you can add your family members, access more charts and make your profile public.

### How can I delete my transactions and account?

You can delete all your transactions and your account at any time under the profile settings.

### Is EuroBonus Charts free to use?

Yes, EuroBonus Charts is completely free to use.

### Where are all my transactions from before 2017?

SAS currently only exports data from 2017.

### Why are my total points spent so high?

This is due to the fact that award bookings and refunds are shown as duplicates across all point sharing members in the pool. You can solve this by uploading transactions from all point sharing members under [profile settings](./profile).

### Why is there an Unknown bar in my plot?

The Unknown bar represents transactions that could not be categorized. This can happen when the system fails to identify the transaction with a specific vendor or partner.

We are continuously improving this webpage and frequently adding new partners to ensure all your transactions are accurately categorized.

### Where can I make suggestions or report bugs?

Feel free to [send us an email](mailto:eurobonuscharts@gmail.com) if you have any improvement suggestions or questions regarding transactions.
